```python

    for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
        df_plot = dfj_skills_perc[dfj_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
        sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_perc', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')
        ax[i].set_title(job_title)
        ax[i].set_ylabel('')
        ax[i].set_xlabel('')
        ax[i].get_legend().remove()
        ax[i].set_xlim(0, 78)
```

#### Insights
When considering a career in data analysis, potential compensastion for applicable skills utilized, and longevity in the field always appreciated.

The compensation structure across data roles, we observe indicates a logical increase in salaries as experience and role seniority progress, though the desired job role does not necessarily guarantee the highest salary.

Starting with Data Analysts, the average annual compensation is around $85,000. However, some Data Analysts report salaries that match or even exceed those of Data Scientists. 

Data Engineer and Senior Data Analyst positions show higher median incomes, though some outliers in compensation align closely with Data Analyst salaries. The higher compensation in these roles also reflects greater experience and the application of more advanced skills, leaning toward development immersion. Interestingly, while Data Analyst roles have lower salaries, they generally involve fewer responsibilities, allowing skill development without as much pressure.

As we move to Data Scientists, the median salary slightly surpasses that of Data Engineers. However, the upper end of compensation for Data Scientists can exceed those in more senior roles, like Senior Data Engineers and Senior Data Scientists, with potential earnings reaching up to $400,000. The median salary of Data Scientists sits around $130,000, a logical progression from Data Analyst roles, aligned with the increased skill requirements.

Overall, median salaries increase with both seniority and specialization, but those positions less often posted, and typically graduated into after time in a lesser position. 

Senior roles, such as Senior Data Scientist and Senior Data Engineer, not only command higher median salaries but also exhibit greater variability in earnings, reflecting the increased responsibilities and compensation diversity at higher experience levels.

#### Insights

Data Analyst:

- Average salary: around $85,000.
Variability exists, with some Data Analysts earning on par with Data Scientists, especially if they bring niche skills or work in high-demand industries.
Generally involves fewer responsibilities, which can be appealing for gaining foundational experience with less pressure.

Data Engineer / Senior Data Analyst:

- Higher median salary than Data Analysts, reflecting more advanced technical skills and responsibilities, often in data architecture or engineering aspects.
Compensation growth aligns with skills like advanced SQL, cloud data storage, and ETL (extract, transform, load) processes.

Data Scientist:

- Median salary: around $130,000.
Upper salary range can reach $400,000 for top-tier professionals, especially those in highly technical or strategic roles.
Data Scientists benefit from the combination of strong analytical skills, coding, and machine learning, and the field offers an appealing career and compensation trajectory.

Senior Roles (Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer):

- Highest variability in salaries, driven by demand for advanced expertise, leadership responsibilities, and often industry-specific requirements.
Reflects not just seniority but also a diversity in skill sets and roles that companies value differentl.

#### Data Analyst: The Best Place to Start

Foundational skills in widely used programming languages like Python often offer a better return on investment than niche tools, even if the latter can be valuable in specific roles. Python, as one of the top-paying skills, is versatile across many data and tech roles, making it indispensable, especially when paired with other analytical tools. 

These include technologies like SQL, Tableau, and Power BI also hold significant weight due to their broad applications in data visualization and analysis.

Itâ€™s interesting to note the pattern with Microsoft Office tools (Excel, PowerPoint, Word) generally being associated with lower salary ranges compared to more specialized programming and visualization software. While essential, these Office tools may not command the same compensation as skills like Python or SQL, which are critical for more advanced data tasks.

The data suggests a clear action plan: prioritize deepening expertise in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools. These foundational, high-demand skills create a strong basis for many advanced roles and help position you competitively in the job market, both in terms of employability and earning potential.

### What the Charts indicate.

Project Summary: 

- Data Analyst Compensation and Skill Optimization
In this project, we aimed to identify the most lucrative and in-demand skills for data analysts, building on our analysis of skill counts and compensation across a variety of data-related roles. Using Python and visualization libraries, we created comparative graphs to bring clarity to these insights.

Key Insights:

- Data Analyst Positioning: Through our analysis, we now understand how data analysts compare to other data science roles in terms of compensation. While data engineers and scientists typically command higher salaries, data analysts can achieve competitive compensation, particularly when equipped with high-demand, specialized skills.

Compensation by Skill: 

- Our findings indicate that while niche technologies like dplyr, Bitbucket, GitLab, Solidity, Hugging Face, Couchbase, Ansible, MXNet, Cassandra, and VMware offer high compensation, they are generally less in-demand. 
- By contrast, core technologies like Python, Tableau, R, SQL, SAS, Power BI, PowerPoint, Excel, and Word appear frequently in job postings, making them both in-demand and essential for many roles.

Skill Optimization for Data Analysts: Combining our compensation and demand data, we identified that skills such as Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI provide an optimal balance of high demand and competitive compensation. While tools like Excel and PowerPoint are still important, more advanced tools tend to offer a better ROI for both career growth and compensation potential.
